# Weekly Meeting Dates
## Semester I
### Welcome to CyberDragons (09/01/2023)
#### Meeting Summary
Our first meeting will start with a brief overview of what GSMST CyberDragons does and a rundown on each major competition we will focus on for the school year. After, we will tell students to install *VMWare Player* on their personal laptops (we will tell them they need their personal laptops days in advance). Next, we will go over CyberDragons applications. To conclude the meeting, we will walk through about *ten* easy vulnerabilities on the Windows 10 qualifying image to show new members how practice images work and how they are scored in real time. We will also emphasize throughout the entire meeting that new members should join the CyberDragons Discord server if they have any questions or need support.

#### CyberDragons Application Requirements
The application deadline is **September 18** at 11:59 PM. This means that members have two and a half weeks to complete the CyberDragons application, starting **September 1**. The requirements are as follows:

- Spend at least six hours on a qualifying image of your choice, and do the best you can. There is no need to email your image results like last year, as the images will be graded live by a remote scoring server (assuming you have an Internet connection). This also means that each applicant's progress can be monitored in real time.
- Complete the short answer questions Google Form.
- Pay $30 or get a fee waiver from Ms. Rachkovsk
- Complete the Team Phi Google Form for free membership (if you are a member of *Girls Who Code*)

As a side note, the point of the qualifying images is to gauge which operating system you enjoy working with, and as a result, all applicants are strongly encouraged to work with more than one of the qualifying images. While it is true that image scores will not be considered in th application, the top *six* scorers will join team Zeta, and the top scorer will receive a prize.

#### Meeting At-A-Glance
- Overview of what CyberDragons does
- Go over how competitions work/which ones we are competing in
- Announce applications and qualifying images
- Demo the Windows 10 qualifying image

### CyberPatriot 101 (09/08/2023)
#### Meeting Summary
Our second meeting of the year will show members how to work on CyberPatriot practice images by dividing them into two groups. One group will be focused on solving a GNU/Linux practice image led by Bibek, with the other focused on Windows and led by Andrew. After twenty minutes, members will switch groups to learn more about the other operating system. Essentially, this meeting will expose a lot of new members to using an operating system for more than just casual browsing and work, but since that may be boring for a few of our returning members, we will also be reviewing some command-line basics.

#### Meeting At-A-Glance
- Separate into two halves (GNU/Linux and Windows 10)
- Explore command-line basics in Windows Powershell, Bash, and Command Prompt (CMD)
- Go over common vulnerabilities seen in practice images for both operating systems
    - This is basically expanding on the intuition they will gain from doing the qualifying images
    - But of course, since everyone procrastinates, there is a great chance that *nobody* would have started the qualifying images by this point. And therefore, this meeting will be helpful for newcomers who would still need a foundation of things to look out for while doing the qualifying images
